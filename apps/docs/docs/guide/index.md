# Getting Started

This guide covers the agent console: how to use every feature from the
inside, once you already have an instance running. If you haven't
installed Seredina yet, start with
[Installing with Docker](/deployment/).

## Creating your organization

Visit `/register` on your instance and fill out the form — organization
slug, your name, email, and password. That first registration
automatically makes you an administrator — there's no separate CLI
bootstrap step.

::: tip One registration in self-hosted mode
If your instance runs `SEREDINA_MODE=self_hosted` (the default mode),
only one organization can register — this is intentional, see
[Cloud mode](/deployment/cloud-mode) if you need more than one.

## The getting-started checklist

The first time you log in, the dashboard shows a "Get started" widget
with four tasks: customize your ticket statuses, set an SLA policy,
create a macro, and invite a teammate. It's not mandatory to complete in
order — it's a guide, not a forced flow — and you can hide it at any time
with the eye icon in the widget's corner.

## Inviting your team

From **Settings → Users**, invite people by email so they choose
their own password (needs a connected email channel), or create the
account with an initial password and share it yourself. See
[Users and roles](/guide/administration#users-and-roles).

With [single sign-on](/guide/administration#single-sign-on-sso) and
automatic account creation turned on, you don't create accounts at all:
people sign in with their Microsoft or Google account and get the role you
chose.

## How this guide is organized

In the console, the sidebar holds the day-to-day work (tickets, contacts,
processes, the knowledge base and the CMDB). Everything that configures the
workspace is under **Settings**, at the bottom of the sidebar, grouped and
searchable. On a phone, the sidebar opens from the menu button at the top.
