# AI Copilot

The copilot has three modes, from least to most autonomous, all available
from the same [ticket detail view](/guide/tickets#the-properties-panel).

## Summarize

The **Summarize** button generates a short summary of the whole ticket —
useful for picking up an old case or handing it to another agent without
re-reading the entire thread. It shows up in a highlighted panel above
the messages, and never replaces the real history.

## Suggest reply

**Suggest reply** drafts a response based on the ticket's content and,
when it finds something relevant, on published
[knowledge base](/guide/knowledge-base) articles (semantic similarity
search, not exact keyword matching). The draft appears directly in the
reply box — the agent edits it or sends it as-is, it's never sent on its
own. If it used an article, it's listed as "Based on:" below the box.

## Triage of new tickets

**Settings → AI Settings → AI triage of new tickets** has the AI read each
new ticket's subject and first message (or an alert's description) and pick
a priority and one of your teams:

- **Off** (default): nothing happens.
- **Suggest**: the ticket shows "AI suggests priority …, team …" with the
  reason and an **Apply** button.
- **Apply automatically**: the priority and team are set right away, but
  only if nobody set them already (a priority chosen on a catalog form or
  mapped from an alert's severity is kept). An internal note on the ticket
  says what changed and why.

Triage runs in the background after the ticket is created, so it never
slows down intake. It works for every channel, email included. Each new
ticket costs one small model call, shown under AI cost transparency as
`triage`.

## Autonomous mode ("Let AI try")

Here the copilot can investigate the ticket and, if confident, **act** on
it — not just draft text. The key difference from the two modes above is
that it can actually execute tools (look up data, change status, assign,
apply a macro, add a reply), always subject to the tenant's Autonomy
Policy.

### Autonomy Policy

From **Settings → AI Agent Activity**, you configure:

- **Auto-execute tool allow-list** — only the tools explicitly allowed
  there execute immediately. Any other call lands in a "pending approval"
  state for a human to review before anything happens.
- **Daily action limit** — a hard cap, independent of how many tools are
  approved for auto-execution.

Every call — auto-executed or pending — lands in the same audit log, with
the tool used, its arguments, the result, and where the call came from
(the internal copilot, or an external agent via the
[MCP server](/api/mcp-server) — they share the exact same catalog and the
exact same rules, there's no separate path with fewer controls for
external integrations).

## AI cost transparency

**Settings → AI Usage** shows the real dollar cost of every copilot
call, aggregated per tenant. Since the AI provider key can be the
tenant's own (bring your own key, from **Settings → AI**), Seredina never
adds a markup — the cost shown is exactly what the provider charges.

## No AI provider configured

If neither the tenant nor the deployment has an AI key configured, these
three buttons return a clear error instead of failing silently or
blocking the rest of the app — the rest of Seredina works exactly the
same without AI configured. See
[Environment Variables](/deployment/environment-variables#ai-copilot-optional)
to configure a provider at the deployment level.
