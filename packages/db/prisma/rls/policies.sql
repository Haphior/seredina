-- Run once, after `prisma migrate deploy`, by the one-shot `migrate` service — never
-- by the running api/worker processes. Idempotent: safe to re-run on every deploy.
--
-- Two roles, on purpose (see docs/adr/0001-multi-tenancy-rls.md):
--   app_migrator — owns every table (whoever CREATEs a table owns it; Prisma migrate
--                  connects as this role). Postgres table owners BYPASS RLS by
--                  default, which is exactly why the running API must never connect
--                  as this role.
--   app_tenant   — non-owner, used by apps/api and apps/worker at runtime. RLS only
--                  applies to non-owners, and FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY (below) closes
--                  the one remaining gap: a superuser/owner override.
--
-- The app_tenant role itself is created/password-set by migrate-entrypoint.sh
-- (via a plain shell heredoc, substituting APP_TENANT_DB_PASSWORD) BEFORE this file
-- runs -- not here. psql's `:'var'` interpolation does not reach inside a
-- dollar-quoted (`DO $$ ... $$`) body, so doing the idempotent create-or-alter
-- dance in SQL with a parameterized password does not work; plain shell substitution
-- has no such restriction, so that's where it belongs.
